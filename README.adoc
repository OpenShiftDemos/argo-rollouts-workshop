### OpenShift Argo Rollouts Workshop

#### Introduction

This workshop provides an Argo Rollouts 101 experience on OpenShift using the OpenShift
GitOps operator. It walks workshop attendees through the process of using blue-green
and canary strategies with Rollouts as well as automated testing using Analysis.

#### Installation

Eventually this workshop will be available in RHDP but for now it can be installed as follows:

* Provision OpenShift Workshop 4.13 instance in RHDP with the desired number of users
* Login on the command line as the `admin` user with the credentials RHDP provided
* Modify `bootstrap/bootstrap/ansible/bootstrap.yaml` to set the number of users you need, this must match the number of users selected in RHDP
* Run the command `./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh`

Note that the installation is using ansible so you must have ansible installed on your system along with the requirements to use the ansible
k8s module.
