https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/[Argo Rollouts,window='_blank'] provides a
drop-in replacement for Kubernetes deployments with support for advanced deployment
strategies. Specifically whereas Kubernetes deployments support simple rollout and
recreate strategies, Argo Rollouts supports Blue-Green and Canary strategies.

To support these advanced deployment strategies, Argo Rollouts provides additional features
including enabling the usage of analysis to drive the progressive delivery. These analyses,
specified in an AnalysisTemplate, enables the testing of the Rollout by defining the nature of the
testing, the frequency and occurrence and what constitutes a pass/fail.

Support for Argo Rollouts is provided by the OpenShift GitOps operator as a Tech
Preview feature as of OpenShift GitOps 1.10.
